A Drum Machine, Synthesizer and Sequencer developed in late 2019 for the unit "Introduction to Computer Programming"

See example.png and example.wav for examples of the program in use.

Using the program:

Upon running the GUI launches. The main section of the GUI is the 6 x 16 grid of buttons and drop-down menus. Each row of the grid represents a sound and each column represents a Â¼ beat. Press a button to add the corresponding sound to the audio loop at the corresponding beat, use the drop-down menu to do the same with musical notes. The sliders directly to the right of the grid can be used to change the labelled parameters of the sounds that they are inline with. The Attack Filter button turns on the time varying frequency low pass filter for the Low Synth and the Filter button turns on the simple low pass filter for the Top Synth. The Mute buttons can be used to mute any channel and the master gain will change will the volume of the entire loop. The BPM entry field is used to change the BPM between a range of 100 and 180 and requires the enter button to be pressed for the change to be made. The Play button will generate the audio, update the plot and then play the audio on loop until the pause button is pressed. The user is then able to make changes with the buttons, sliders or BPM but these changes will not be applied until the play button is pressed again.

The save button saves the currently stored audio as a .wav file with file name entered in the text entry above it.
